# Kiesraad organization profile

GitHub allows you to show the contents of a README file on your organization's profile page,
in our case that's https://github.com/kiesraad. This README needs to reside in a `.github` repository as desribed in [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile#organization-profile-readmes). This is that repository.
